FsHttp ("Full Stack HTTP") is a "hackable HTTP client". It's purposes are:

* Use it as a replacement for `.http` files, *VSCode's REST client*, *Postman*, and other tools as an **interactive and programmable playground** for HTTP requests.
* Usable as a **production-ready HTTP client** for applications powered by .Net (C#, VB, F#).

The design principle behind FsHttp is to specify HTTP requests in a most convenient and readable way, while still being able to access the underlying Http representations for covering unusual cases. It's the best of both worlds: **Convenience and Flexibility**.

**FsHttp** is developed and maintained by [@SchlenkR](https://github.com/schlenkr) and [@dawedawe](https://github.com/dawedawe). Feel free to leave us a message.

A Simple Example
----------------

An example in F#:

```fsharp
#r "nuget: FsHttp"

open FsHttp

http {
    POST "https://reqres.in/api/users"
    CacheControl "no-cache"
    body
    jsonSerialize
        {|
            name = "morpheus"
            job = "leader"
        |}
}
|> Request.send
```

An example in C#:

```csharp
#r "nuget: FsHttp"

using FsHttp;

await Http
    .Post("https://reqres.in/api/users")
    .CacheControl("no-cache")
    .Body()
    .JsonSerialize(new
        {
            name = "morpheus",
            job = "leader"
        }
    )
    .SendAsync();
```

Building
--------

**.Net SDK:**

You need to have the latest .Net SDK installed, which is specified in `./global.json`.

**Build Tasks**

There is a F# build script (`./build.fsx`) that can be used to perform several build tasks from command line.

For common tasks, there are powershell files located in the repo root:

* `./test.ps1`: Runs all tests (sources in `./src/Tests`).
  * You can pass args to this task. E.g. for executing only some tests:
    `./test.ps1 --filter Name~'Response Decompression'`
* `./docu.ps1`: Rebuilds the FsHttp documentation site (sources in `./src/docs`).
* `./docu-watch.ps1`: Run it if you are working on the documentation sources, and want to see the result in a browser.
* `./publish.ps1`: Publishes all packages (FsHttp and it's integration packages for Newtonsoft and FSharp.Data) to NuGet.
  * Always have a look at `./src/Directory.Build.props` and keep the file up-to-date.
